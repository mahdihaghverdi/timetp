In a Python User Group (@PyFarsi in telegram), a problem was asked:
> How can I get a string like `4d5w16h78m65s` and parse to get information out of it?

Then I started to explain that you can write a littel parser
with this DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) and then parse it easily

This is the DFA:
